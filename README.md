Whisper Notes is a WIP note transcription tool. It uses [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), OpenAI's general-purpose speech recognition model to transcribe audio files.

It allows the user to upload an audio file which is then sent to a python script for processing and transcription. The transcript is returned to the user in the browser.
